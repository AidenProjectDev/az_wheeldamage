# az_wheeldamage

Hello,
Here is a small script that allows you to have realistic damage on your vehicle wheels, here are the conditions to activate the detachment of a wheel :
- Make a jump that lasts more than 1 second (configurable in the config.lua)
- Make a collision with a certain speed (configurable in the config.lua)

The script is not perfect, but it is open source to allow you to correct some problems if needed, I decided to do it following a post on the FiveM forum of Kuzkay who was selling his script for about 10 euros encrypted, so I started to document myself to see how to make it made in Azeroth and here it is !

The script adds functionality that does not exist in the base as the fact of being able to collect the lost wheels to be able to put them back and a trigger or a command for the mechanics that will allow them to repair the vehicle with the detached wheels, repairing a vehicle does not repair the wheels, so it is necessary to put them back by hand or via a specialist.

The limitations of GTA make that the motorcycle wheels are not detachable, so they are immune. I also limited the wheels for boats, planes and helicopters. The off-road wheels allow to override the fact of losing a wheel via height but not via collisions.

Known bugs:
- Vehicles can sometimes bug and go under the map (rare but it can happen)


I hope you'll enjoy my work,
Sincerely, Azeroth
